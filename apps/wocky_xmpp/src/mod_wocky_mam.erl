%%%
%%% This module provides the archive_message_hook and lookup_messages_hook that
%%% are called by `mod_mam' to archive and retrive messages.
%%%
%%% See XEP-0313 for MAM details and XEP-0059 for Result Set Management (RSM)
%%% descriptions.
%%%
%%% Data is stored in the `message_archive' table and the `archive_id'
%%% materialized view. Of particular note are the two fields `id' and `time'.
%%% These are both unique, chronologically ordered IDs for the message. The key
%%% difference is that `id' is supplied by MIM when it archives the message. It,
%%% rather unfortunately, relies on Erlang's `now/0' function, the use of which
%%% is now frowned upon. In order to avoid our code relying on that, the `time'
%%% field is a C* v1 UUID which also encodes that time at which the message was
%%% archived. Thus, in this module, `id' is treated as a unique identifier, but
%%% we rely on neither its ordering nor its encoding of the message's timestamp,
%%% both of which are instead supplied by `time'.
%%%
%%% While archiving is relatively simple, there's a bunch of different ways to
%%% look up messages. Each option has an optional limit on the number of
%%% messages returned by the request. Each can also be asked to return a pair of
%%% counts, as described below:
%%%
%%% * Time-only:
%%%     Provides a start and/or end time and optional limit.
%%%     Counts are:
%%%         * Total messages in the archive within specified time range
%%%         * Messages in archive before first returned
%%%
%%% * Borders-only:
%%%     Provides an `#mam_borders{}' record with inclusive or exclusive start
%%%     and/or end ID values.
%%%     Counts are:
%%%         * Total messages in the archive within the specified range of IDs
%%%         * Messages in archive before first returned
%%%
%%% * RSM ID-paging:
%%%     Uses a `#rsm_in{}' record to provide Result Set Management paging. This
%%%     allows forward or backwards paging from a specified ID.
%%%     Counts are:
%%%         * Total messages in the archive
%%%         * The index of the ''oldest'' message in the returned set.
%%%
%%% * RSM Index-paging:
%%%     Provides jump straight to a fixed offset into a user's full archive,
%%%     using the `index' field of an `#rsm_in{}' record. Note that this is
%%%     necessarily a slower operation than any of the above (and is specified
%%%     as such in the RSM XEP) since the concept of an "index" is based
%%%     entirely on the number of items in the archive and cannot therefore be
%%%     easily optimised beyond O(N).
%%%     Counts are:
%%%         * Total messages in the archive
%%%         * The index of the first message (should match requested index
%%%           assuming that falls within the valid range)
%%%
%%%
%%% Other random notes:
%%%
%%% The `rms_in.max' field is at all times treated as being interchangeable with
%%% the `PageSize' parameter. If one is `undefined', the valid value will be
%%% used. It is an error to call `lookup_message_hook' with two different
%%% integer values in these fields.
