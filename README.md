Wocky blah blahsdfasdfasdf
========
This is the main server-side software. At the moment, it incorporates an XMPP
server which will be extended with custom functionality.

Building
========
For information about prerequisites, please refer to the MongooseIM
documentation.

In order the checkout the code and initialize the Git submodules, pass the
`--recursive` flag to `git clone`:

    $ git clone --recursive git@github.com:hippware/wocky.git

Alternatively, if the repository is already checked out, you can use the
following commands:

    $ git submodule init
    $ git submodule update

Then, the rebar3 package index needs to be initialized by typing:

    $ ./rebar3 update

This tells rebar3 how to fetch rebar3 plugins. It only needs to be done once.

To build, once the repository is checked out type

    $ ./rebar3 compile

This will download all of the dependencies and compile everything. Once the
code is built, start the application using:

    $ ./rebar3 shell

To create a production release, use:

    $ ./rebar3 release

The production release will be built in _build/default/rel/wocky. If you want to
run the release, you can:

    $ cd _build/default/rel/wocky
    $ bin/wocky console

If you want a tarball of the production release use the command:

    $ ./rebar3 tar

Database schema and seed data
=============================
You can create the database schema and load it with seed data using:

    > wocky_db:bootstrap().

To create the schema without loading seed data use:

    > wocky_db:create_schema().

Runtime diagnostic tools
========================

The Wocky application includes a number of runtime diagnostic tools. You can
find more information on these tools below:

* redbug: https://github.com/massemanet/eper/blob/master/doc/redbug.txt
* recon: http://ferd.github.io/recon/
* binpp: https://github.com/jtendo/binpp/blob/master/README.md
* pretty\_errors: https://github.com/eproxus/pretty_errors/blob/master/README.md

In addition, there are a number of helper functions that can be used in the
shell defined in the module `user_default.erl`.

Module naming convention
========================

To help keep everything straight we are following a simple naming convention.

Erlang modules that:
* interact with the database are prefixed with 'wocky\_db'
* implement functionality unique to wocky as ejabberd modules are prefixed with
'mod\_wocky'
* implement backend functionality for existing ejabberd modules follow the naming
convention established by ejabberd with 'wocky' as the backend name (i.e.,
'ejabberd\_auth\_wocky' or 'mod\_roster\_wocky')

Repository separation
=====================
Wocky incorporates an open source XMPP server. It also contains fully
proprietary custom functionality. In order to separate public intellectual
property from private intellectual property, the source code needs to be
partitioned into distinct repositories.

This repository contains fully proprietary code and features.

Wocky is the "top level" project and the XMPP server is a component sub-project.

In the development environment, this is the "parent" git repository and the
XMPP server is a nested git repository located in the `ext/` directory (managed
by `git` as a submodule). In other words, the development tree has (at least)
two git repositories. This is important to keep in mind.

Wocky is the "top level" Erlang release and the XMPP server (along with other
components) is a dependency.

Nesting of git repositories is accomplished by telling git to ignore the deps/
directory (ie. `deps/` is listed in .gitignore). This method may not be the best
nor standard way of nesting git repositories but it is the most natural fit to
the directory structure used by Erlang/OTP and various build tools (ie. rebar).

This repository will contain all of the custom functionality and features which
extend the vanilla XMPP server.
